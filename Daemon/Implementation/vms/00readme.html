See the <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html"
>CERN server documentation</A> for detailed descriptions of the
<b>v2.16 httpd</b> and explanations of how to use it.
<p>

To build the server, execute DESCRIP.MMS, BUILD_MULTINET.COM or
BUILD_UCX.COM in [.LIBRARY.IMPLEMENTATION.VMS] to create the common
object library (<b>WWWLib.olb</b>), then execute the corresponding file
in [.DAEMON.IMPLEMENTATION.VMS] to build the server (<b>HTTPD.exe</b>),
clickable image support (<b>HTImage.exe</b>), and authorization file
utility (<b>HTAdm.exe</b>).  If you do not yet have a <A
HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Clients.html">W3 client</A>,
you can build the simple Line Mode Client (<b>WWW.exe</b>) with the MMS
or appropriate command file in [.LINEMODE.IMPLEMENTATION.VMS] to check
out the server.
<p>

Start by testing the server as a detached process on port 8001
with TRACE implemented, after reading all the headers and comments
in the foo_HTTP8001.COM files, HTTP8001.CONF, and SPAWNINIT.COM.
<p>

Read the headers and comments of the other foo.COM and foo.PP files for
information on what they do and how to use them.
<p>

If the server checks out OK on port 8001, install it on port 80,
either:
<p>
<ol>
<li>as a detached process by using SUBMIT_HTTP80.COM,<br>
or
<li>under Inetd (MultNet's MULTINET_SERVER or UCX's AUX) with a
system logical (HTTPD_CONFIG80) pointing to HTTP80.CONF, and after
INSTALLing the image /SHAR/OPEN/HEAD to speed up initiation of
multiple Inetd processes.
</ol>
